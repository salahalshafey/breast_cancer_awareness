# Breast Cancer Awareness



## A Flutter project is mainly used for 
* Assisting Doctors with `deep learning models` for Breast Cancer detection.
* Providing `information and awareness` of this disease.
* Facilitating `self-examination` through a symptom checker.
* Offering support `resources` and `guidance` for patients. 
* Chatbot providing answers and guidance through text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities.
* Web Search `Google Search, Google Scholar, Wikipedia`.
